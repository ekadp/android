This is an example for Bluetooth Connectivity for an Android App.

You can use this codes example, to test connectivity with devices using Bluetooth arround you.

After you can connect to a device, as shown as in this "bluetooth.png" capture, 
you can add method for any Bluetooth Device to work as you want. For example, you
can add printing method to this Java codes example, so you can connect to a 
Bluetooth printer device, and then print a document.
